#Add a function below called divisors(num) which takes one argument of type integer

#A divisor or factor is a number which divides evenly leaving no remainder

    #set up an empty list to hold your result
    
    #loop i from 1 to the number you are checking
   
        #if the remainder when dividing the number by i is equal to zero - i is a divisor so...
